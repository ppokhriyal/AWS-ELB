Elastic Load Balancing
======================

- Elastic Load Balancing automatically distributes the incoming traffic to
  attached targets such as EC2,Container and IP addresses in one or more availability zones.

- It monitors the health of the attached targets and route the incoming traffic to the
  healthy targets.
  If the attached target is un-healthy,it will stop routing the traffic to that un-healthy target
  until it is healthy again

- It automatically scale the load balancer as the incoming traffic changes over the time.


Types of Load Balancers
=======================

- Application Load Balancer
- Network Load Balancer
- Gateway Load Balancer
- Classic Load Balancer

and route the traffic to that target group.
